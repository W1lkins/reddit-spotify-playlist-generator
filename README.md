# reddit-spotify-playlist-generator ðŸŽµ

A simple way to generate a Spotify playlist based on posts from a specific
Subreddit.

Uses praw for interacting with the Reddit API and Spotipy to interact with the
Spotify API.

You'll need a developer app on Reddit which can be created
[here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). You'll also need a developer app on
Spotify which can be created
[here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

    -e REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=<reddit-client-secret> \
    -e SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=<spotify-client-id> \

                   [--playlist-name PLAYLIST_NAME] [--username USERNAME]

optional arguments:

                        Name of playlist to create on Spotify
  --username USERNAME   Spotify user to create playlist for
```

## Development

You'll need all the aforementioned environment variables exported within your
environment:

```console
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=<reddit-client-id>
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=<reddit-client-secret>
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=<spotify-client-id>
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=<spotify-client-secret>
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=<local-callback-uri>
```

Then, ensure python3+ is installed and run `make virtual`.

Next, run `source venv/bin/activate` then `make install` to install the libraries in `requirements.txt`.

You should now be able to run `make` which will run `./generate.py`
